# What is Native Trade?

Native Trade is a practice project! It's an e-commerce application focused on eco-conscious home goods and clothing.


# What Inspired This Application? 

I'm a fan of being as waste-free and eco-conscious as possible! Although I don't actually sell any of this stuff, I'd probably buy all of it. I started this project for practice building with React, Redux, Firebase, and Stripe.

# Installation 

1. Clone the repo onto your machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install any dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to boot up the application.
4. Click around.
